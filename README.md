##This Verilog-based RAM DESIGN project was developed using VS Code for coding, Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for simulation and waveform analysis, with ChatGPT assistance for code correction and debugging.

# ðŸ§  Synchronous RAM Design Using Verilog

## ðŸ“Œ Project Title
**Design and Simulation of a Synchronous RAM Using Verilog**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To design, implement, and simulate a synchronous Random Access Memory (RAM) module using Verilog HDL. This RAM allows read and write operations on the rising edge of the clock and supports enable and write control signals.

---

## ðŸ§© Features

- **Synchronous operation** (clock-driven)
- **Read/Write control** using `we` (write enable)
- **8-bit data width**
- **16-word addressable memory**
- Designed using behavioral Verilog
